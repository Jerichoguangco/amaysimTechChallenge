Thoughts:
   Hi! I made this extra section to share my thoughts upon making this test. In order for me to help you know how I usually do things. Any instructions, advice is greatly appreciated as I am mostly self-taught and believe have a lot of room to learn (seriously).

1. I tried making it exactly like this below 

---------------------------------------------
cart = ShoppingCart.new(pricingRules)
cart.add(item1)
cart.add(item2, promo_code)
cart.total
cart.items
--------------------------------------------- 

however, due to perhaps my lack of knowledge, was unable to do it exactly this way. Instead, I made on-click events that updates itself, insert rows for each item, and the things that needs to be updated. 

2. I tried using Javascript naming convention using camelcase when building the sample app.

3. I thought of making extra-steps like showing a checkout list, reduce cart items when pressing the cart, and a bunch of other interesting stuff. But I recalled amaysim's core value "simplicity", so I avoided going outside what was instructed and not do anything unnecessary. 

4. I also thought of separating the javascript (JS) and simple CSS file from the html file (making it external), but since this test app doesn't require those JS and CSS files to be used on other projects, I decided to make it internal instead.  

5. It was my first time using github, and was amazed on how useful it is. (I wonder why Mekeni didn't use this).

5. I recalled Ms.Judy's advice, "Enjoy the test". Thanks Ms.Judy!
